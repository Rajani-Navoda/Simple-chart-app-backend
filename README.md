This repository contains the development of a basic chat application, focusing on the backend functionality.
The application features both server and client components, allowing multiple clients to connect to the server and communicate with each other.
The project is developed in several versions, each adding new features and capabilities:

Version 1: Establishes the basic connection between a single client and the server.
Version 2 & 3: Introduces the capability of client and server sending and receiving multiple messages until they choose to stop.
Version 4: Expands the application to support multiple clients connecting to the server simultaneously.
Version 5: Implements multithreading to handle multiple client connections, enabling concurrent communication without interference.
